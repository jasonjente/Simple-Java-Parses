Simple java parsers using stacks formed from linked lists with generics . Used in the TagMatcher.java reading each line of the file,
adding a push for an opening bracket and a pull for a closing one. If at the end the stack is full it prints a message.

Queue implementation for integers, same as before with linked list with generics, with a simple example implementing the queue in IntQueue/IntQueueImpl and NetBenefit.
